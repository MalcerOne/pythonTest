# Python Developer Job Test

For this task, you will be creating a Python script that scrapes course info from coursera.org

The script should have an interface where you can enter a category name corresponding to a Coursera category such as Data Science: https://www.coursera.org/browse/data-science

Then the script will collect all courses from this category and place them into a CSV file. Here is the info that is required from each course:

- Course name
- Course provider
- Course description
- Number of Students enrolled
- Number of Ratings

Once finished, the script should place the CSV file on the server and provide a link to access it.
Once you are done, upload your script to the web that shows the interface which allows the user to select a coursera category.
